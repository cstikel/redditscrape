**But what's next?**  
The project team recently released a roadmap for 2023. In this roadmap, we can see many interesting changes. For example, the introduction of multi-chain technology. This will make the security of the Defi sphere available to many consumers. But the main blockchain will remain Solana, which the project team continues to support.

**What else besides covering financial risks?**  
The amulet protocol is not only a cover for the defi sector, but also a profitable SOL staking. With the aUWT wrapped token, everyone can earn passive income with a high APY. High APY liquidity pools are also available. There are 9 pools available, including Hubble Protocol, Kamino Finance and Orca.

**What is known about the Amulet Protocol project?**  
Amulet Protocol (""**Amulet**"") is a decentralized risk protection protocol (""**RPP**"") built for Rust-based ecosystems, starting with the Solana blockchain. Amulet has designed an innovative and open risk protection model which not only effectively addresses the common challenges of existing decentralized RPPs, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the whole risk protection sector.

Amulet's vision is to offer **Simple, Reliable Cover for everyone in Web3**. With the addition of Amulet, users in the entire Rust-based ecosystem will gain access to a new way to hedge various risks with cover product offerings.

**Where can I get answers to questions about the project?**  
If you are a beginner and do not know anything about the amulet protocol, you can get more information on the project website or come to the discord. The project team is almost always online and will answer all your questions.

9,Thoughts on P2e games?,0,11a2bwd,CryptoMarkets,/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/11a2bwd/thoughts_on_p2e_games/,8,"Hi everyone!

Myself and my friend have spent the last year developing our web-based location finding play-to-earn crypto game in the evenings called Proofoftreasure. 

As hobbyist Devs we wanted to have a play around with some crypto smart contract coding, but also thought it could be a way for the game to fund itself and further development.

Would love to know your guys thoughts on P2E gaming. I know there's big ones like axie etc, but seems to me like the coins are either way overvalued, or worth nothing? I kinda think itd be best if the coin value would tie in with the value of the game - so for example the devs being able to make the same amount as selling the game would.

Any thoughts?",1677170861.0
